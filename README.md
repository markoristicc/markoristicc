Some Public Projects:
* [Project Dragonfly](https://github.com/markoristicc/Sensor_Stick): 
This is my Capstone Project where I worked with a small team to create a low-profile sensor stick, which connects to drones via microUSB, along with associated firmware which performs Extended Kalman Filter state estimation using ROS library robot_localization, and performs visualizations in RViz
* [MIPS Multicore Microprocessor](https://github.com/markoristicc/MIPS_MultiCore_Processor): 
In this project, a partner and I implemented a dual-core microprocessor in verilog, complete with separate 2-way set associative LRU caches for instruction set and data memory, as well as a local 2-bit saturating branch predictor
* [Ultimate Cache](https://github.com/markoristicc/ultimate_Cache): 
This was my final project for Algorithmic Decision Making, where a partner and I implemented an adapative cache algorithm that achieved better performance than LRU, LFU, or MRU alone. (In certain situations ðŸ˜¬)


Some Private Projects:
* Linux OS:
This was a working Linux Kernel for a simulated MIPS architecture, complete with an I/O subsystem, process scheduling, multithreading, and inter-process communication.
* $\lambda$+ Interpreter: 
This was a fully working interpreter, written in OCaml, for a functional programming language. In creating this interpreter, I had to implement the operational semantics of the language, as well as efficient type-checking and Hindley-Milner Type Inference.
